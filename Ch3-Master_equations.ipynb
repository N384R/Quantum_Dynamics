    "The Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) master equation, often known as the *Lindblad* master equation:\n",

    "$$\\dot{\\rho}(t) = -\\frac{i}{\\hbar} [H, \\rho(t)] + \\sum_k \\gamma_k \\left(L_k\\rho(t)L_k^\\dagger - \\frac{1}{2}\\Bigl\\{L_k^\\dagger L_k, \\rho(t)\\Bigr\\}\\right)$$\n",

    "where $\\{L_k\\}$ are the *Lindblad* operators representing some non-unitary processes like relaxation or decoherence that occur at some rates $\\{\\gamma_k\\}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Like the Hamiltonian generates coherent dynamics, the Lindblad operators generate incoherent transitions in the space of states. Unlike the Hamiltonian, they do not need to be hermitian. For example, a decay transition from some excited state $|e\\rangle$ to some ground state $|g\\rangle$ is mediated by the Lindblad operator\n",

    "$$L_\\downarrow = |g\\rangle\\langle e|$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, when we apply $L_\\downarrow$ to $|e\\rangle$ we obtain $|g\\rangle = L_\\downarrow|e\\rangle$. Note that $L_\\downarrow^\\dagger = |e\\rangle\\langle g| \\neq L_\\downarrow$.\n",

    "This Lindblad equation is used to approxiamte the evolution of the density operator of a system $\\text{S}$ with Hamiltonian $H$ that is weakly coupled to a Markovian (memory-less) environment, and is a general form for a **completely positive and trace-preserving (CPTP) Markovian** and **time-homogeneous map** for the evolution of the system's density operator $\\rho$."
