    "\n",
    "While the Lindblad master equation is guaranteed to be completely positive and trace-preserving, care must be taken when using BR theory. First, the following approximations have to be respected to obtain the BR equation from the reducedstate von Neumann equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Weak coupling approximation:** The interaction $H_\\text{int}$ is a small perturbation of the unperturbed Hamiltonian $H_0 = H_\\text{S} + H_\\text{E}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Born approximation:** The system-environment density operator is factorized at all times, $\\rho_\\text{int}(t) = \\rho_\\text{S}(t) \\otimes \\rho_\\text{E}$ with $\\rho_\\text{E}$ being some steady state of the environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Markov approximation:** The bath correlation functions $g_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\tau) = \\text{Tr}[B_\\alpha(\\tau)B_\\beta(0)\\rho_\\text{E}]$ have a short correlation time scale $\\tau_\\text{E}, g_{\\alpha\\beta}(\\tau) \\approx 0$ for $\\tau \\gg \\tau_\\text{E}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Rotating wave approximation:** All the contributions from the rapidly oscillating terms, i.e., with characteristic frequency $|\\omega_{ab} - \\omega_{cd} \\geq \\tau_\\text{E}^{-1}$, are neglected as they approximately average to zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the BR master equation does not, in principle, guarantee positivity of the density operator. That is, when propagating the system in time $\\rho(t) = \\Lambda_t[\\rho_0]$, the populations of $\\rho$ may become negative for some time $t > 0$. For this reason, when propagating a density operator numerically, it is advisable to check its positivity. The following python script can be used to test positivity, hermitianity and normalisation condition of a density operator. The function 'is_state(rho)' returns $1$ if a rho is a density operator, and a value $s < 1$ if rho deviates from the conditions of positivity, hermitianity and normalisation, where $1 − s$ is a measure of such deviation."
